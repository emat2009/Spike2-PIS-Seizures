# Spike2-PIS-Seizures
This code was written in Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design, ced.co.uk) to examine mouse intracortical EEG signals for automated seizure detection based upon both threshold crossing and post-ictal suppression

The approach and initial testing is under review for publication: A simple, automated method of seizure detection in mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy, Matthews, Harward.... McNamara

There are accessory files that allow the user to apply filters to the raw data, visualize the sonogram of the EEG, or cut out individual animals from the data file. These are not required to run the seizure detection.
